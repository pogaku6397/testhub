Manual Installation:

    Creation of jenkins user

    Create a user with name jenkins useradd jenkins
    set password for jenkins passwd jenkins
    Make him admin(add him to sudo'ers group) usermod -aG wheel jenkins
    
    check: usermod -aG wheel jenkins
    output: uid=1001(jenkins) gid=1001(jenkins) groups=1001(jenkins),10(wheel)

    Installing docker:

    Update the packages on your instance sudo yum update -y
    Install Docker sudo yum install docker -y
    Start the Docker Service sudo service docker start or systemctl start jenkins systemctl enable jenkins
    systemctl status docker
    Add user jenkins to docker group sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins

Note: You should then be able to run all of the docker commands without requiring sudo. After running the 4th command I did need to logout and log back in for the change to take effec

    Installing docker compose

    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    docker-compose version

    come to the home directory of the jenkins user (i.e: /home/jenkins)
    As jenkins user, install git: sudo yum install git -y
    

    Jenkins installation setup with dockercompose:

    To install docker docker-compose up -d

Note: Most ot the time you will get permissions issues.This is because, the /var/jenkins_home directory inside container is owned by jenkins user with uid 1000.So if you want to link a volume make sure the directory should be owned by user with same uid(i.e 1000).Here user is not important but only uid is important.Even if same uid is used by other user.

    sudo chown -R 1000:1000

    Install remote-host with dockercompose:

    Created dockerfile in dockerslaves/
    Created ssh keys and copied public key to conatiner
    Added private key in jenkins and created a jenkins creds with that
    Inatlled ssh plugin
    configured ssh to run basic task in remote shell
    Finally executed docker-compose up -d, which launches 2 conatiners
